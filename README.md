pfSense on bootstrap
====================

We are migrating pfSense to Bootstrap. You can help! Please respect these code-guidelines:

* use tabs (tabstop=4) for indenting (except the license-header which contains 3 lines that are indented with "\t   ")
* no trailing whitespace
* limited echoing of HTML from php, please use proper templating syntax instead (eg. foreach/endforeach)
* limited attributes on elements; _no style attributes_
* no inline javascript
* html attributes should be using double-quoted attribute-values. This means your php-code should probably use single-quoted strings
* we use icons for status-indication and buttons for actions

If you feel adventurous you can sometimes rewrite some PHP & javascript code as well; but try to keep this to a minimum.
