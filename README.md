Description:
When only ONE Captive Portal zone is created then its tedious and useless to select this zone
when you want to see the status of this zone.

The patch will show the status directly if only ONE zone is active.

The possibility of selection will be maintained if more then ONE zone is activated.

Changed file : /usr/local/www/status_captiveportal.php
